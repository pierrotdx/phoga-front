# PHOGA

PHOGA is a project of PHOto GAllery intended to have separate back end and front end. The present project is the front-end component which is composed of a client website to display photos and a private back-office to manage photos.

## Preamble

### Mainspring

The truth behind this project is that it is actually a playground for the author to discover and play with some development concepts such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture and unfamiliar tools (Docker, ...).

As such, some choices of architecture or libraries are not based on efficiency but rather on the sake of discovery or simplicity, depending on the case.

### Current state

The API is still under development and not ready for production.
