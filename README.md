# PHOGA

PHOGA is a project of PHOto GAllery intended to have separate back end and front end. The present project is the front-end component which is composed of a client website to display photos and a private back-office to manage photos.

## Preamble

### Mainspring

The truth behind this project is that it is actually a playground for the author to discover and play with some development concepts such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture and unfamiliar tools (Docker, ...).

As such, some choices of architecture or libraries are not based on efficiency but rather on the sake of discovery or simplicity, depending on the case.

### Global structure

This project is composed of three sub-projects:

- the client application to display photos to visitor,
- the back-office application to add/edit/remove the client photos,
- a library shared between the two applications.

### Current state

The project is still under development and not ready for production. The staging version of the client can be previewed [here](https://phoga-client-dot-phoga-449314.ew.r.appspot.com).
